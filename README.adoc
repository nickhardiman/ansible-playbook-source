= Ansible playbook for turning a PC into a set of source VMs

Ansible helps me assemble my home lab. 
This playbook turns a PC running RHEL 9 into a hypervisor running a pile-load (that's the technical term) of Virtual Machines. 
Each VM runs a set of services that support my home lab. 

. *gateway* hosts Bind, Squid, Postfix, NFS, haproxy, cockpit
. *idreplica* replica for Red Hat IDM (LDAP, CA, DNS)
. *capsule* proxy for Red Hat Satellite
. *aapee* Ansible Automation Platform Execution Environment node

Under construction. Sections marked with !!! and ??? are notes to self. 


== hardware

I use the playbook on this PC. 

* 64GB RAM 
* 1TB storage
* 4 core CPU

It's a lot of memory, and yet it isn't enough. 
It's never enough. 


== Operating System

I use the playbook on this OS. 

RHEL 9, fresh minimal install


== the KVM/QEMU hypervisor 

A bootstrap shell script kicks off the install. 
See instructions in 
https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-source/blob/main/bootstrap.sh[bootstrap.sh].



== Virtual Machines

The https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-source/blob/main/group_vars/all/main.yml[defaults file] defines a lot of values. 
For instance, most 
MAC addresses are set to ** 52:54:00:11:00:* **,  and 
IPv4 addresses are set to ** 192.168.11.* **.

== cheat sheet


=== PC and OS

Start with a machine running RHEL 9. 
A fresh minimal install is fine. 

Only tested on a box with one ethernet interface, plugged into the network.


=== edit the bootstrap script

Script 
https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-source/blob/main/bootstrap.sh[bootstrap.sh] 
sets up everything on a freshly installed host. 

* Log into the hypervisor machine.
* Download the script.

[source,shell]
....
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-source/main/bootstrap.sh
....

* Read the script 
* Follow the instructions and edit the script.
